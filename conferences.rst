Notes about conferences
=======================

Tibs' notes on PyCon UK 2019 are at https://github.com/tibs/pyconuk2019-notes

So why go to a conference?
==========================

* Learning - of course
* Networking - making new friends
* Socialising - meeting old friends
* Validation - rebuilding enthusiasm
* Involvement - and paying back

Expanding on those:

* Learning: if a technical conference is any good you'll learn things from
  program items, and possibly also just from talking to people. Sometimes
  this can be an overview of a new field, sometimes a specific tool or
  library. I've always come away from PyConUK having learnt at least a
  couple of significant things. And this is one of the places where
  lightning talks can shine.

* Networking: it's a good place to make contacts within the Python
  community, and possibly withone one's own field as well. This also
  includes recruitment (the last several UK Python conferences have had
  specific recrtuitment sessions, and of course sponsorship acts as
  advertising)

* Socialising: it's nice to meet people you've got to know at previous
  conferences. For science fiction conventions, this is a principle element
  of the con, of course.

* Validation: there's a grand sense of "I'm doing the right thing" gained
  from going to a conference of people doing the same sort of thing
  (whether if be programming C, programming Python, or building embedded
  systems and doing device bring up). This can revitalise your involvement
  with what you're doing, and boost enthusiasm in general. Which is a Good
  Thing, and I think should not be underestimated.

* Involvement: it's good to get involved. This can be as simple as
  representing the company at a recruitment event, presenting a lightning
  talk (it can be constructed at the last minute!), or doing some session
  chairing (really, not so hard). Paying back to the conference and the
  community is a nice thing to do, and makes one feel good as well.

  And, of course, if you get involved people get to know you, and that's
  part of networking...
